# Library App

This app will enable borrowers to log the books they take out on loan. Initial loan period will be one week.
It is a work-in-progress that was started during an Innovation Day hosted by Alfa Systems by a team of 7.

Technologies used include React, Spring Boot and the Google Books API.

## Key Stories

As an library user, I want to see a list of books that are in the library, before I go to the library. - GET request

As a library manager, when I have a new book, I want to add it to the library. - POST request

As library user, when I am interested in a book, I want to see the title and author of that book

## Borrowing Actions

As a library user, when I really like a book, I want to take it out on loan.

As a library user, when I take out a book, I want to know when book is due back in the library, so I can return it on time (concept: fix it to a week initially)

## Using the app

- Clone this repo
- Navigate to library-app folder
- Run `npm install --save axios` in Command Prompt/Terminal to get node modules and includes axios in the package
- Run `npm install --save react-router-dom` in Command Prompt/Terminal to include react-router-dom in the package
- Run `npm start`
- To stop app use `ctrl+c` for Command Prompt or `cmd+c` in Terminal

## Progress so far

The React app is currently presenting book information and thumbnail image for a single book which is fetched via the Google Books API.

The Spring Boot backend is utilising a database to implement a catalogue of books based on ISBN as the key. It allows for books to be taken out on loan by a user and for multiple copies of a book.
